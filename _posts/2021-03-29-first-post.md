## Some more post

I have just returned from a *visit* to my **landlord** - the solitary `neighbour` that I shall be troubled with.
This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so
completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are
such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart
warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up,
and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I
announced my name.
